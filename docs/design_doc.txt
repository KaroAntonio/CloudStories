The Most popular branch is always showed, this gives the most popular branch a bias but it also encourages longer, as opposed to broader stories. 

It represents a compromise to develop deep stories.

A 'detour' symbol indicates when you are on a branch that is not the most popular branch,

Aug 4, 2015 :: Gamified Design Outline

Goals of app, to encourage participation, meaningful reading and writing 
pts for writing, reading, and being read.

xp: worthless, mainly used to give superficial rewards
prestige: is awarded by being read, cannot be 'spent' just reallocated
rank: is either a decorative title or a lvl which can be bought or acheived with prestige

Each user can only award points to the story they are currently reading.
    (Add current story to user table)

READING is almost worthless because it's so difficult to verify that you're reading effecitvely

WRITING earns xp just for writing (100xp maybe), lines earn xp + prestige when read.

OR Everytime a story is read, all of it's parents also gain prestige, simplifying the system 
    Still has the problem of multiple reads of the same line artificially inflate a story's value.
    
FANS - you get feedback on how many fans you have, who's your biggest fan, etc...

send messages to your no. 1 fans? No. the only form of writing contributes to the story

CUSTOMIZE branch layout, whether the top branch is at the top, a random branch is at the top

the system should reward good writing, not high prestige.

In order to encourage good writing, only x amount of lines are allowed per person...?

Does that mean you must be logged in to write lines?

Anonymous lines are culled after a certain amount of time if they have no visits.

UNLOCK Tree View
more prestige/ rank allows you to write more?

Voting on your story:
Only users award prestige through reading.

The game then uses a user backed currency.

Offer a smaller, cheaper, shorter poetry/short story award
offer an award for $1 and $5 categories

launch October (16-20) on a tuesday

Offer different Tiers for Toronto, Canada Wide and US.

Dedicate a few pages to listing every author in the book, authors names are scaled to reflect the number of pages written

For word cult(ure) advertise with physical print of generated stories 

SQL DATABASE
if the site sees more the 100K hits per day, upgrade the database

BOOKMARK Feature

Add A search feature, search for a phrase in the tree

use mailchimp to send emails

i. upgrade the database and website infratructure so it can handle more people
ii. email validation
iii. social feedback
iv. bookmarking
v. search
vi. ranks
vii. experience benefits

you can buy/earn characters (how many characters per line)

ADD Admin control, list users, add/drop users, ...modify users? .. add/drop lines, send emails

Q: Can the internet write a good crowdsourced story?

wrdcvlt is probably the best bet to answer that. Of course, she's my baby, so I'm biased.

It works like this:
You start at the first line, choosing each line you want to read, kind of like a choose your own adventure.
When you come to a point where you feel like your imagination is better than the story you're reading, you add to the story and write your own lines.
wrdcvlt keeps track of how popular stories and lines are: as you read, you're automatically voting on the story, that's how the invevitable randomness of the internet is organized.

Some people like reading, some writing, some both, (some neither...what?) if you're curious to see how this experiment will work out but don't really want to write, share! I'm pretty excited to see how this will pllocay out so any help to make it happen is really appreciated : )

VII
LETS WRITE A ST0RY, INTERNET
wrdcvlt.

1. Read the beginning of the story.
2. Read 2 or three more lines...
3. Decide you're too smart for this shit
4. Write a better ending for the story
5. Some other guy writes a new line, un-ending the story
6. go to step 3

These are the electric sheep of which androids dream

As an alternative to email spam:
    an in app feed that users have to log in to view
    *persistant,dynamic and in the main display
    
New leaves/buds feed
check if leaves written 
maintain a table of 'parent author notified'
or maintain a list in user of all new leaves they've been notified of

Have you ever been playing a game and thought, man, why aren’t I writing a story at the same time? Have you ever been reading a book and thought, why arent I earning any points for this?

Hey Internet, let's write a book together, it's going to be internet good 

For wrdcvlt have a list of readers/authors that are close to you
